### Project 1: Default Prediction from Lending Club Data
This project is a part of the course Data Science for Business 1 at Aalto University.The dataset was the loan data of Lending CLub downloaded from Kaggle, containing data that has already been cleaned. The goal of the project was to build different predictive models so as to predict whether a customer is likely to pay back the loan or not. Because the data was imbalanced, SMOTE method was applied to balance the data. However, the models are built from both original and balanced data.

3 models were built: 2 Logistics Regression models( one with balanced and imbalanced data) and Decision Tree with balanced data. The precision, recall, accuracy and AUC scores, and expected benefits of 3 models are calculated. In summary, Logistic Regression with balanced data is chosen for prediction because it has highest expected benefit, highest AUC score and highest accuracy score.

### Project 2: Vaccine data: ETL process and exploration
This project is a part of the course Databases for Data Science at Aalto University. In this project, ETL process is built.The data from excel sheets are extracted, tranformed, and loaded to the database. Later, the data exploration work is conducted.

### Project 3: Survival Analysis- Predict survival rate for e-scooters. 
This project is a module of the course Data Science for Business 2 at Aalto University. The dataset includes 283 observations of 283 scooters with 7 attributes.
A survival analysis with Kaplan Meier Estimator is conducted with the historical data to build a survival analysis model to predict the survival rate of the scooters. Moreover, a survival analysis with Kaplan Meier Estimator for scooters of manufacturers A,B, and C are also conducted.

Log-rank test is conducted to confirm the difference among the survival rates of scootters from manufacturers A, B, and C. 2 models(Cox Regression and Random Survival Forest) are built  to predict the survival rate of the scooters. Later, those models are used to predict the survival rate of 10 new scooters which were not included in the original dataset.
